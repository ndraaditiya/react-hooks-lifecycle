# react-hooks-lifecycle

In this project you all will know lifecycle of React Hooks (How and when it's rendered)

In this project I use some React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, useId, useMemo, useCallback, useTransition and I also add a simple Custom Hook. Fyi, useMemo iss for memorized variable, and if you want to memorized a component, you can use memo() in your component, you can see how implementing memo() on Second Child Comopnent.

Then, I also implementing AbortController or CancelToken (on axios), i add the explanation on commented sentences in the project, how and why we should using it. This picture below is just example when the fetching is canceled because i click Get Data Comments and after that straight ot click Get Data Photos

See the commented sentences and the console.log to know how and when the element rendered, or to know how and when the function executed/called.
