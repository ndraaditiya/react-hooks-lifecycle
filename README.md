# react-hooks-lifecycle

In this project you all will know lifecycle of React Hooks (Howw and when it's rendered)

In this project I use some React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, useId, useMemo, useCallback and I also add a simple Custom Hook.


See the commented sentences and the console.log to now how and when the element rendered, or to now how and when the function executed/called
